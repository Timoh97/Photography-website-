        <h2>Brief description.</h2>
    </u>
    <p> I grew up thinking I would rise to a very senior profession;
        a <strong>pilot</strong> to be exact. To me, the title looked very beautiful, attractive and big. I had
        plans to pursue
        either aviation or Aeronautical Engineering.
        All the dreams faded when I joined high school. Though I passed, I was unable to fulfil
        my dream of being a pilot. For real, the urge to be a pilot gives me a rush that I can't explain up to date.

    <p>I am zealous about solving real world problems through computer programming and I look forward to be a
        <strong>competent Software Engineer</strong>. You can check qualities of a good <a

        I love Mathematics and coding. During my free time, I either figure out <strong>mathematical
            concepts</strong> or I am on my
        computer crunching my <strong>python,Javascript and Java codes.</strong>
        I love being a <strong>Software developer</strong>.
    </p>
    <p> I am an out-going person; adventurous to be precise. Adventure makes me feel alive in a world so cold.
        Below is the collection of my pictures.
        The pictures show my adventure in life; in real world and in the internet.
